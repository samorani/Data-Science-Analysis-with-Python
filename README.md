# Data-Science-Analysis-with-Python

This repository contains the material I use to teach "Data Science Analysis with Python" to MBA and MSIS students at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.

## Software Used
The course is developed in Python 3.6. We will use <a href="https://conda.io/docs/index.html">Anaconda</a> as package manager. Once Anaconda is installed, all you need is a browser!
