# Data-Science-Analysis-with-Python

This repository contains the material I used to teach "Data Science Analysis with Python" to MBA and MSIS students at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.

## Software Used
The course is developed in Python 2.7. I use <a href="https://store.enthought.com/downloads/">Canopy</a> as package manager. The slides in <i>Module 1 -- set up and python review</i> illustrate how to install and set up Canopy. Once Canopy is installed, all you need is a browser!
